Description\r\n\r\nDream-Quest is a competitive game where players assume the role of a dreamer, existing in two different realities at once \u2013 each player has an avatar in the \u201creal\u201d world part of the board, and also one on the \u201cdream\u201d part of the board. The real world represents the repetitive routine of everyday life, that the characters have to endure before going to sleep and continuing their epic quest in the alternate reality.\r\n\r\nIn the dream world, meanwhile, the players are racing to complete an epic quest and achieve complete physical transition into the world of dreams, which represents the only escape from the boring gray of everyday routine.\r\n\r\n## Game components\r\n\r\n### Reality game board\r\n\r\nCyclic graph, graphically fashioned to represent a clock, symbolizing the repetitive nature of real world. Some nodes may have special rules written directly on them.\r\n\r\n### Dreamlands game board\r\n\r\nA mostly linear progress board, with multiple chutes-and-ladders-like shortcuts. Board is fashioned in a way that contrasts with the reality board, with magical forests, vast irregular cities, mysterious caverns and the like.  The nodes on the dream board are color-coded to represent potentially dangerous areas.\r\n\r\n### Real events deck\r\n\r\nA deck of cards representing events happening to the real-world avatars of the players. These have effect on the dreamtime.\r\n\r\n### Dream events deck\r\n\r\nA deck of cards representing encounters the players\u2019 dream avatars experience on their journey.\r\n\r\nCharacter sheets representing the character the player has chosen for the adventure\r\n\r\n## Basic stats\r\n\r\n**A character sheet contains these elements:**\r\n\r\n- Twice the size o normal card\r\n- Character name and occupation\r\n- A short story of the character background\r\n\r\n### Memory value\r\n\r\n- **Range:** 2+ to 6+\r\n- **Mod:** ++/-- token\r\n\r\nUsed to determine where the character resumes from on the dream-path when they return to sleep\r\n\r\n### Slumber value\r\n\r\n- **Range:** 0 to 12\r\n- **Mod:** Clock\r\n- **Icon:** ZzZ..\r\n\r\nRepresents for how much longer the character can maintain their existence in the dream world. If a character\u2019s Slumber value hits 0 at any time, they wake up.\r\n\r\n### Lucidity value\r\n\r\n- **Range:** 0 to 6\r\n- **Mod:** ++/-- token (slider)\r\n\r\nRepresents how much control the character can exercise over the dream realms. Lucidity is used to determine the outcome of encounters. The players may also attempt to wake up other players using lucidity (provided they are on the same space as the other character).\r\n\r\n### Providence value\r\n\r\n- **Range:** 0 to *x*\r\n- **Mod:** 1/2/5 tokens\r\n\r\nRepresents the knowledge the character has accumulated during their journey. Providence is amassed during play and is used during the final encounter.\r\n\r\n## Basic rules\r\n\r\nEach player has two player avatars, one in the real world and one in the dream world. Each player gets one action per turn. This action can be taken in the real world or in the dream world, depending on which player avatar is active. The players begin the game awake, and can use the real-world action to move one space, take a real-world event card, and then fall asleep. This means that the next round, they get to activate their dream-world avatar instead. Likewise, when the player in dream-world should wake up, they can only activate their real-world avatar in the next world.\r\n\r\n*Maro\u0161 Be\u0165ko, Oliver Pa\u010dut, M\xe1ria \u0160virikov\xe1*\r\n*Fall 2018, PA215 Game Design I.*")}})},r}return Object(d.a)(t,e),t}(a.Component);Object(b.createCheckers)(A).Cards.check(v);var P=function(e){function t(){var e,r;Object(s.a)(this,t);for(var n=arguments.length,o=new Array(n),i=0;i<n;i++)o[i]=arguments[i];return(r=Object(c.a)(this,(e=Object(l.a)(t)).call.apply(e,[this].concat(o)))).state={cards:Object(g.groupBy)(v.cards,"type")},r.render=function(){return[a.createElement(m.a,{className:"sticky-top",light:!0,color:"light"},a.createElement(u.a,{className:"card-brand"},"DreamQuest"),a.createElement(h.a,null,a.createElement(p.a,{href:"#"},"Home"),a.createElement(p.a,{href:"#Rules"},"Rules"),Object.keys(r.state.cards).map(function(e){return a.createElement(p.a,{href:"#".concat(e)},"".concat(e," cards"))}))),a.createElement("main",{role:"main"},a.createElement(y.a,null,a.createElement(f.a,null,a.createElement(E,{title:"Rules"}),a.createElement(Z,null)),Object.entries(r.state.cards).map(function(e){return a.createElement(f.a,null,a.createElement(E,{title:e[0]}),e[1].map(function(e){return a.createElement(V,e)}))})))]},r}return Object(d.a)(t,e),t}(a.Component);Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));i.a.render(n.a.createElement(P,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}},[[35,2,1]]]);
